# Lawrence of Arabia - Man of Mystery?

This site explores the life of T.E. Lawrence, the myths and legend that surrounds him.
It asks what happened that caused him to withdraw completely from a very public life.
Of course, answers are in short supply, but perhaps even 85 years after his death, the
truth is still out there.

The site is aimed at the interested viewer - interested, that is, in people and events in world and military history. 
It will also be of interest to students of psychology.


## Features

- The site comprises a landing page which introduces Lawrence in general terms, and three further pages which focus on 
particular aspects of his life and career. The pages are linked via a menu bar.
- The structure of each page is identical: a header and footer area sandwich the main content area. The content area is
divided vertically on a two-thirds:one-third basis, with the larger space holding the main content and the smaller space
containing subsidiary information.
- The site is fully responsive.


## Testing

### Validator Testing

- HTML
Each page showed a warning message: "Section lacks heading. Consider using h2-h6 elements.....".
I am inclined to leave this alone since the section is contained within an article element which has a header.

- CSS
No errors were found when passing through the official (Jigsaw) validator.

### Unfixed Bugs

- Sticky footer 
The sticky footer overlaps the bottom of each page, hiding content. This is particularly noticeable with the timeline on the landing page. I tried a
number of code 'fixes' without success. There is one option I haven't tried, using 'flex' display. Time is short so I'm leaving this for now.


## Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

- In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
- From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch
- Once the main branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
