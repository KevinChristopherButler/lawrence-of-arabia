# Lawrence of Arabia - Man of Mystery?



## Testing

- HTML
Each page showed a warning message: "Section lacks heading. Consider using h2-h6 elements.....".
I am inclined to leave this alone since the section is contained within an article element which has a header.

- CSS


### Validator Testing


### Unfixed Bugs

- Sticky footer 
The sticky footer overlaps the bottom of each page, hiding content. This is particularly noticeable with the timeline on the landing page. I tried a
number of code 'fixes' without success. There is one option I haven't tried, using 'flex' display. Time is short so I'm leaving this for now.

## Deployment

The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows:

- In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
- From the source section drop-down menu, select the Main Branch
- Once the main branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
