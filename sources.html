			    In 1998, Harvard University Press published <a href="https://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674704947" target="_blank">A Prince of our Disorder</a> by John E. Mack. This is an excellent biography which explores in some depth the man behin the myth. Of course, all the main events and adventures of Lawrence's life are here, but Mack also examines the psychological aspects of Lawrence's actions and decisions.

			    Lawrence wrote his own account of the Arab Revolt, which he named <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/64683.Revolt_in_the_Desert" target="_blank">Revolt in the Desert</a>. He intended that this would be read only by his friends, but the book acquired a life of its own when he expanded his account in <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/57936.Seven_Pillars_of_Wisdom" target="_blank">The Seven Pillars of Wisdom</a>. The original manuscript for 'Seven Pillars' was mislaid by Lawrence and he had to rewrite it from memory since he had destroyed his notes while writing the first draft. Lawrence reveals much of himself but still witholds much too. The chapter on Deraa is a masterpiece of obfuscation - he tells us he was captured by the Turks while carrying out a reconnaissance of the town but, as he managed to hide his identity, he was released after a few days. It is clear that he suffered much during this brief captivity, probably including sexual assault, but he admits of nothing explicitly. It is left to the reader to divine what lies between the lines. It is no surprise that Lawrence said he wrote and rewrote the chapter many times before he arrived at the published version.

			    Twenty years after his death, Doubleday published <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/767350.The_Mint" target="_blank">The Mint</a> by Lawrence, an account of the time he spent in the RAF after the war. This is a frank account of his time away from the limelight and hints at the reclusive life he sought at his Clouds Hill cottage, sustained by simple interests such as motorcycling through the countryside. While he tried to live anonymously and avoid his old responsibilities, he nevertheless found barracks life difficult. Living in close proximity with others was difficult for him.
