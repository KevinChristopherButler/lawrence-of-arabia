                            The general public perception of Lawrence is the figure of Peter O'Toole battling harsh desert conditions, enemy troops, inner demons and, on occasion, his allies. He is seen as a pawn in General Allenby's offensive against the Turks while also coming under fire from his Arab allies for not being able to deliver their promised independence. Fittingly, he exits the stage quietly, the conduct of the war and subsequent peace passing to other hands.

                            At the time, the British fear was that Lawrence was 'going native', or had already 'gone native'. Physically, he had adopted Arab dress, spoke Arabic fluently, rode a camel expertly and had generally adjusted well to desert life. More seriousy, he had a very strong relationship with the Sherif of Mecca and his sons, the princes Feisal and Hussein. Militarily, his actions were often at odds with thinking at headquarters. He avoided pitched battles, decided on his own objectives within the broader strategy, and generally acted above his rank at all times.

                            Curiously, Lawrence is seen in a bad light by French historians. According to Lawrence's own accounts, he was unaware of the secret Sykes-Picot Agreement whereby the French and British governments divided the former Ottoman territories in the Middle East into separate spheres of influence. It is hard to know if he is being honest sbout this, but the French certainly thought he was aware of Sykes-Picot and yet promised independence to the Arabs. Of course, some of these Arabs would soon be 'French' Arsbs, and the resentment caused by broken promises led to violence in the French mandated territories in the 1920s and 1930s.

                            The attitudes of the various Arab peoples are mixed. The Arab Revolt was never a united effort: Arab society was still strongly tribal, and armies were assembled from uneasy alliances of sometimes hostile tribes. It was inevitable that some tribes - and the leaders of those tribes - would fare better than others after the war. Lawrence's main allies were drawn from the Hashemite Kingdom of what is now Saudi Arabia. The Hashemite dynasty was supplanted by the Ibn Saud dynasty after the war, but the Hashemite princes who served with Lawrence, Feisal and Hussein, were awared kingdoms of their own in Syria and the newly-created Transjordan (now Jordan). This has had repercussions right up to modern times: Jordan's population is approximately 80% Palestinian and 20% Hashemite, but the monarchy and ruling class, including top military positions, are all Hashemite.

                        <h2>Who are you?</h2>
			<p>
			David Lean, in his film 'Lawrence of Arabie', subtly questions Lawrence's identity. Was he British or Arab? A soldier or pacifist? A realist or a dreamer? At one stage we see Lawrence, having crossed the Negev and Sinai deserts, arriving at the Suez Canal. On the Egyptian side of the canal, a British soldier on a motorcycle sees Lawrence's Arab aide trying to attract his attention. The soldier shouts above the wind, "Who are you? <i>Who are you?</i>". In fact, during filming the soldier had not shouted anything at all - the shouted question was dubbed in afterwards by Lean. The voice used was his own.
