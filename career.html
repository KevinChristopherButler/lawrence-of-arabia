                            Lawrence graduated from Oxford with an Honours Degree in History. He carried out research for his thesis on Crusader Castles on site, travelling throughout Palestine and Syria on his own. During this time, in addition to material for his thesis he also acquired a knowledge of Turkish, French and Arabic. Always a scholar, Lawrence later worked on archeological excavations in Syria and Turkey.

                            With the outbreak of war in 1914, Lawrence enlisted in the army and was commissioned as a lieutenant. He was posted to the Military Intelligence section in Cairo where his draughting skills were put to good use drawing up maps of the Gallipoli peninsula. In 1916 he was sent to the Hejaz area in the Arabian peninsula to report on the progress of the Arab Revolt against the Ottoman Empire. In fact, the revolt was faltering, and Lawrence became involved in the military direction of the campaign. His first objective was to identify prospective allies, and he quickly settled on the Hashemite princes Feisal and Hussein, sons of the Sherif of Mecca. With their help he was able to unite various Arab tribes, temporarily at least, in a series of actions against Turkish outposts. In particular, he destroyed sections of the Hejaz railway in order to isolate Turkish garrisons. This avoided casualties - on both sides - and rendered the Turkish forces impotent. His greatest achievement at this time was the capture of the fortified Turkish port of Aqaba, achieved by attacking the fortifications from the landward side have crossed an expanse of supposedly impassable desert. The final stage of the campaign involved a joint operation with the conventional forces of General Allenby which led to the capture of Jerusalem and Damascus.

                            After the war, Lawrence represented the Arab delegation at the Versailles peace conference. Needless to say, the Arabs did not achieve the full independence they felt was their due. At best, a form of independence was obtained, as a subservient monarchy or government under a British or French mandate. To oblige the Hashemite princes, Feisal was made king of Syria while Hussein was made king of the newly-created state of Transjordan. Neither appointment was popular with the local populations - who were certainly not Hashemite. Following Versailles, Lawrence acted as an adviser to Winston Churchill at the Colonial Office.

			    At this point, in 1922, Lawrence stepped back from public life. He changed his name to 'Shaw' and enlisted in the RAF as an ordinary aircraftsman (his military rank was colonel). He tried to maintain a low profile but his true identity was soon discovered, and he was dismissed for submitting falsified documentation with his application. He then enlisted in the army as an ordinary soldier under the name 'Ross'. He remained in the army until 1928 before once again enlisting in the RAF. His RAF experience this time round was happier, and he was put to work on designs for high-speed motor launches. Though he didn't live to see it, his work paid dividends in the Second World War when launches based on his designs were employed to good effect in rescueing aircrew who had been shot down.

                        <h2>War in the Middle East</h2>
			<p>
			The war in the Arabian Peninsula and the Middle East was regarded by the Allied command as a 'sideshow'. The feeling was that success against the Turks in this area would not win the war, and might not even cause the Ottoman Empire to sue for peace. The numbers involved in the fighting reflected this view. Unfortunately for those troops, they were also down the pecking order when it came to resupply and reinforcement. While winning might not have brought the desired results, losing was unthinkable. This area included the Suez Canal, the vital link between Britain and India. People with a longer view also recognised the importance of the oil resources in what is now Iraq and Iran. This is the realpolitik that lay behind the Sykes-Picot Agreement, an arrangement drawn up secretly between Britain and France which allocated spheres of influence in the newly-conquered Ottoman territories.
