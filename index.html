                            <p>
			    The short answer is that Lawrence of Arabia was Thomas Edward Lawrence, born in Wales in 1888, but that only scratches the surface. For a start, he was actually born Thomas Edward Chapman - his father's surname was Chapman but he had separated from his wife and was living with his former maid under the name Lawrence. But the image we have of Lawrence is generally that portrayed by PeterO'Toole in David Lean's 1962 film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_of_Arabia_%28film%29" target="_blank">Lawrence of Arabia</a>. Of course, the film takes liberties with dialogue and certain events, but it remains reasonably true to its subject. What it does not tell us though is what came before, and more importantly, what happened after the war.
