                            <p>
			    The short answer is that Lawrence of Arabia was Thomas Edward Lawrence, born in Wales in 1888, but that only scratches the surface. For a start, he was actually born Thomas Edward Chapman - his father's surname was Chapman but he had separated from his wife and was living with his former maid under the name Lawrence. But the image we have of Lawrence is generally that portrayed by PeterO'Toole in David Lean's 1962 film <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lawrence_of_Arabia_%28film%29" target="_blank">Lawrence of Arabia</a>. Of course, the film takes liberties with dialogue and certain events, but it remains reasonably true to its subject. What it does not tell us though is what came before, and more importantly, what happened after the war. 
                             </p>
                            <p>
                            Of course, Lawrence's legend is founded on his activities in the Arabian desert and Middle East region during the war. What is not fully appreciated, perhaps, is Lawrence's abhorrence of warfare as it was then conventionally fought. In particular, he could not stomach a loss of life on the scale of the battles fought on the Western Front in Europe. His approach to warfare was economical, if one can use that word in connection with war. He opted not to attack Turkish formations directly: instead, he preferred to attack bridges and railways, and the trains running on them, thus isolating and rendering impotent the Turkish garrisons. This put pressure on the Turks to resupply their beleaguered forces, or to withdraw them. The result of all this was that the Arab Revolt became regarded as a 'clean' war, attractive for newsreel footage and their domestic audiences. Lawrence, in flowing Arab attire and leading from the front, became almost a matinee idol.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            After the war, Lawrence maintained his connections with the Arab world for a time, representing the Arab interests at the Versailles peace talks. Then, lowing a brief spell as an adviser to an oil company in the Middle East, he quit public life. This aspect of his life is still shrouded in mystery. He was still a young man with much to offer, especially in the spheres of diplomacy or politics. His decision to effectively abnegate himself, effacing his persona, abandoning all responsibilities and connections with his former life remains an area for much psychological speculation. There is no doubt that Lawrence always had a sensitive personality, perhaps due to some extent to the circumstances of his early family life. Perhaps his collapse, if that is how it can be described, was due to a combination of factors: traumatic wartime experiences, his inability to fulfil promises he had made to the Arabs, and the demands made on him to find solutions to intractable problems.
